BT18CSE021 - UJJWAL SHARMA - BATCH 1

This text file is in reference to Question 1
Question 1 contains 3 files
1. Main.cpp
	This is the driver file . All output will be in this file
2. Students.hpp
	This file contain declarations . There are 2 classes 
	1. Student -
		this class contains data members and corresponding functions . Functionality of functions can be determined by their names but a full description is provided inside the corresponding .cpp file
	2. StudentDatabase - 
		this is basically a class to keep collection of students. Again full descriptions of unctions is in corresponding .cpp file 
3. Students.hpp
	This file contains the definitions of declarations in the .hpp file
	2 operators are overloaded 
	1. new - this will allocate memory in heap. Now initially the pointer is void* and we also need to allocate memory for members so we cast it into Student* by using the function reinterpret_cast<type>(expression) so now our compiler will interpret the void* ptr as Student * and then we allocate memory to the corresponding data members
	2. delete - this again takes void ptr as argument but again we will cast the void* to Student * using reinterpret_cast<type>(expression) function as we have to first free the space inside the ptr (i.e student ptr) the we will free the ptr itself
Due to the nature of this new we have to check if the user wises to make an object in the stack ( by not using new) . In that case we simply allocate memory for data members . Explained in the .cpp file itself
Other definitions will be understood as you read the .cpp file along with comments

Compile using the command : g++ *.cpp -o question1
If this does not work I.e gives warning related to c++11 
Then try clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ *.cpp -o question1

Note - All The files compiled successfully and gave output in XCODE
