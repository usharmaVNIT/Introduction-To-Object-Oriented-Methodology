This text file is in reference to Question 3
Question 3 contains 3 files
1. main.cpp
	this is the driver class
2. DoubleLinkedList.hpp
	As all the classes will be template classes so all the definitions will be done in this file.  the compiler will not generate code for them unless they are specifically called
	this file contains 3 classes
	1. DoubleLinkedNode -
		this class is the building block as the nodes are objects of this class . It has 2 friend classes Iterator and DoublyLinkedList so they can access its methods and members freely
	2. Iterator -
		this class is the iterator that will be used in iterating through the linked list
		see the code (file ) for more details
	3. DoublyLinkedList -
		this file throws all the exceptions and has many functions
			insert = insertAfter , insertBefore
			delete = deleteNode
			iterators = getIteratorHead , getIteratorTail 
			print = printDLL , printDLLreverse
			etc...
		as you can see the name describes the functionalities. Read the code (file ) for further explanation
3. DoubleLinkList.cpp
 	As all the classes will be template classes so all the definitions are in the header file .he compiler will not generate code for them unless they are specifically called

Compile using the command : g++ *.cpp -o question3
If this does not work I.e gives warning related to c++11 
Then try clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ *.cpp -o question3
